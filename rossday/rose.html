      <p>
        You're my cute rose, my symbol of love and tenderness. Just like the
        delicate petals of a rose, you bring beauty and joy into my life. You
        mean everything to me, and I cherish every moment we spend together.
        Like a rose, you may face thorns along the way, but I'll always be there
        to protect you and shield you from any harm. On this Rose Day and every
        day, I want you to know how much you're loved and appreciated. You're my
        strong man, and I'm grateful to have you in my life.
      </p>
      <p>From your love, Sahanshila</p>
